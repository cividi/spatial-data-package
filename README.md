# Geospatial Datapackage Specification

This is an example Geospatial Data Package.

This datapackage follows the [Frictionless Data Specification](https://frictionlessdata.io) and defines a way of specifying a simple map view based on geojsons as a data resource to the package.

## Datapackage Structure

### Licenses and Sources

- `Licenses:` Defines the details of the licenses
- `Sources`: Sources that have been used as input

### Rersources

An array of resources with links to or the data itself. Includes a resource `name` (unique inside the datapackage), a `title` and a `description` as well as a `mediatype`. At least one of these should be a geojson or of some other spatial type.

MÃ¶gliche Mediatypes

- `application/geo+json`: GeoJSON with [Mapbox Simple Styles](https://github.com/mapbox/simplestyle-spec)
- `application/vnd.simplestyle-extended`: GeoJSON with [Extended Simple Styles](https://github.com/cividitech/simplestyle-extended-spec)
- `application/vnd.mapbox-vector-tile`: Mapbox URI for styled vector tiles

### Views

An array of rendered versions of the data resources.

Contains extra metadata used for rendering all or a subset of the packages resources.

For a map view compatible with the [Gemeindescan-Project](https://bitbucket.org/cividi/gemeindescan-webui) use the following fields and resources that are either Mapbox Style URI or a geojson that includes styles as defined by the [Simplestyle Spec](https://github.com/mapbox/simplestyle-spec) or [Extended Simplestyle Spec](https://github.com/cividitech/simplestyle-extended-spec).

```json
{
  "name": "mapview",
  "resources": [
      "geojson-resource-name-1",
      "geojson-resource-name-2",
      "mapbox-resource-name"
  ],
  "specType": "gemeindescanSnapshot",
  "spec": {
    "title": "Snapshot Title",
    "description": "Snapshot Description",
    "bounds": [
        "geo:47.43668029143545,9.355459213256836",
        "geo:47.483104811626674,9.424123764038086"
    ],
    "legend": [{
      "shape": "square", // possible shapes: square, circle, line
      "size": 0.5, // 0.1 - 1
      "color": "rgba(255,255,255,0.5)",
      "label": "Legend text",
      "primary": true
    }]
  }
}
```

- `name`: name of the view (unique within datapackage)
- `resources`: an array of resource-names (see above) in order of rendering, first will be lowest in render order
- `specType`: currently only `map` is supported here
- `bounds`: array of bounding box support geopoints, denoted as Geo-URI as defined by [RFC5870](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5870), latitude first
